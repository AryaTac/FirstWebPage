<p1>So i Made my YT Channel at 9 july 2020 and my friends motivated me to make videos and what they would prefer watching and tell me their intrests. So i started making my first video which up to this point was the most watched video that hit 95 views(up to the point im typing this text inti this webpage) and WOW i was surprised adn was ready to do more! then i made some videos of me seeing a thanos truck in roblox, made a story video, and then coding videos. Oh i thought i was ready to go into the bigger youtuber's section as that time i was getting subcribers every hour, but then it stopped to 26, but now i have 27 or even 28 subcribers! </p1>
